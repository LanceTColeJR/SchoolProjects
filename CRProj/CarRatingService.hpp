This method should simply add the CarRating corresponding to the parameter to this CarRatingService. If the underlying car is already in this CarRatingService, then this CarRatingService should update the rating appropriately, keeping in mind the number of ratings in each object and the ratings value for each CarRating object. If this math seems complicated to you, ask Dr. Blythe about it! Finally this method should return a copy of the updated CarRatingService as efficiently as possible.

Make sure to pass the right hand side CarRatingService efficiently and guarantee that it will not be modified by this method. This method should simply add all of the the CarRatings corresponding to the parameter to this collection (making sure to properly handle cars that are already in this CarRatingService.) Finally this method should return a copy of the updated CarRatingService as efficiently as possible.

    //the -= operator should be overloaded with the right hand side being a single CarRating. Make sure to pass the CarRating efficiently and guarantee that it will not be modified by this method.
